Crafted from the collaboration between humans and robots, this eco-conscious stage offers versatility, accommodating music performances and community events alike. The project utilizes state-of-the-art research in human-robot collaborative construction (HRCC), leveraging sustainable practices to design and fabricate a versatile structure from reclaimed dimensional lumber. In the HRCC process, humans and robots combine their respective advantages – the dexterity and decision-making capabilities of humans and the precision and efficiency of robots – in a shared assembly environment. The assembly workflow is enhanced through real-time perception feedback and adaptive control optimization, enabling waste minimization for bespoke construction and advancing current practices toward sustainable automation."},{id:2,name:"Block (and Chain)",logo:"/images/logo-image/block_and_chain_logo.jpg",teamImage:"/images/block_and_chain.jpg",title:"Block (and Chain)",teamUsers:"office ca w/ Fabio Castellanos",description:"Block (and Chain) will feature an innovative interlocking modular setup with universal connection points designed to create an interactive and multipurpose event space. This dynamic setup includes various modules: a static or stationary module that anchors the design and allows other pieces to connect at different intervals; a focused module that introduces diverse views and experiences at each turn; an active module, comprised of four 2-foot cubes, which provides surfaces for climbing and pushing; a calm module offering spaces for sitting, reading, and relaxation; and a selective module that can be moved and integrated with other systems to create unique experiences or enhance existing setups. Together, these modules will transform the space into an engaging and versatile environment for all attendees."},{id:3,name:"SS24",logo:"/images/logo-image/ss_24_logo.jpg",teamImage:"/images/ss_24.jpg",title:"SS24",teamUsers:"A Special Kind of Lie",description:"Spring/Summer 24 intertwines the vibrant essence of Woodstock fashion with cutting-edge architectural practices. It serves as an homage to the freedom, rebellion, and connection to nature emblematic of Woodstock's iconic style while pioneering the utilization of textiles as a primary architectural element. The proposal celebrates the versatility of textiles, drawing inspiration directly from the diverse array of materials, patterns, and styles that defined the clothing of the Woodstock generation. By embracing textiles as the fundamental building block, our installation transcends conventional architectural norms, mirroring the boundary-defying spirit of Woodstock."},{id:4,name:"Rise Repeat",logo:"/images/logo-image/rise_repeat_logo.jpg",teamImage:"/images/rise_repeat.jpg",title:"Rise Repeat",teamUsers:"Leandro Piazzi, Michael Stradley, and Claire Eileen Moriarty",description:"The pavilion makes use of three off-the-shelf elements commonplace in everyday American domestic construction: (1) pressure-treated, pine stair stringers, (2) precast concrete deck footings, and (3) stainless-steel, star-drive deck screws. The repetition of uniform, pre-fabricated elements allows for an economical budget and ease/speed of assembly in the field. Stringer elements are joined mechanically with screws, without the need to cut or modify the elements and without using adhesives or coatings. This light-touch construction method allows for a strategy of disassembly and re-use, considering the full life cycle of the pavilion's materials. After the three-year installation at Bethel Woods, the pavilion can be dismantled and relocated to another site or dismantled and donated to community building organizations in the area to be re-used as gently-used stair stringers in conventional construction. In this way, the project serves as a modest testing ground for a reusable, circular approach to architecture and its materials."},{id:5,name:"MycoShell",logo:"/images/logo-image/mycoshell_logo.jpg",teamImage:"/images/mycoshell.jpg",title:"MycoShell",teamUsers:"Regenerative Architecture Lab + Circular Construction Lab",description:"MycoShell is an installation that exhibits the potential of biological self-growing and adaptive building materials toward a collaborative future of the digital and the analog. MycoShell is constructed of structural mycelium-bound composite panels that have been grown from a local fungal strain of the Ganoderma family on regional agricultural byproducts of corn and hemp. The result is a biobased, carbon-negative, and fully circular building component with structural capacities. MycoShell engages these mycelium-bound panels to form a compression-optimized vault built from individual catenary arches."},{id:6,name:"Curtain Call",logo:"/images/logo-image/curtain_call_logo.jpg",teamImage:"/images/curtain_call.jpg",title:"Curtain Call",teamUsers:"office office",description:'Curtain Call investigates the use of semi-automated construction methods to test the formal, spatial, and structural capacity of light wood framing. Semi-automated construction is a hybrid method that emphasizes human-robot collaboration. Rather than robotically automating the process entirely, this method allows human participants at all skill levels to easily engage in the construction process. Ultimately, this project considers alternate approaches that expand conventional modes of labor relative to the design, fabrication, and construction process. More than just a shade structure, the project provides a highly flexible "stage" that allows for a wide range of programming. It can accommodate informal, impromptu activities such as lounging, picnicking, or reading, or organized festival activities such as movie nights, lectures, pop-ups, and performances of all kinds.'}],f=[{id:1,teamId:1,image:"/images/timberlyn.jpg",audio:"/audios/timberlyn.wav",colors:[[167,149,75,1],[35,45,21,1],[171,200,232,1],[161,195,230,1],[164,197,230,1],[142,121,68,1],[21,29,14,1],[192,216,244,1],[185,211,238,1],[186,212,239,1],[39,49,40,1],[94,107,81,1],[46,53,45,1],[53,73,61,1],[51,62,45,1],[94,101,83,1],[177,171,139,1],[149,129,102,1],[250,210,161,1],[124,136,112,1],[218,184,139,1],[203,177,126,1],[216,182,154,1],[222,193,127,1],[238,216,156,1]]},{id:2,teamId:2,image:"/images/block_and_chain.jpg",audio:"/audios/block_and_chain.wav",colors:[[122,164,126,1],[116,158,120,1],[122,164,126,1],[122,164,126,1],[124,169,130,1],[123,165,127,1],[122,164,126,1],[122,164,126,1],[119,161,123,1],[80,166,91,1],[125,170,131,1],[119,161,123,1],[31,201,224,1],[114,119,125,1],[54,94,120,1],[126,163,129,1],[113,120,126,1],[96,90,58,1],[123,165,127,1],[122,164,126,1],[122,164,126,1],[122,164,126,1],[129,169,132,1],[83,178,94,1],[125,160,127,1]]},{id:3,teamId:3,image:"/images/ss_24.jpg",audio:"/audios/ss_24.wav",colors:[[223,223,223,1],[237,237,237,1],[251,251,251,1],[92,92,92,1],[255,255,255,1],[104,104,104,1],[111,111,111,1],[239,239,239,1],[130,148,168,1],[138,138,138,1],[96,96,96,1],[198,204,218,1],[126,126,126,1],[101,97,98,1],[122,122,122,1],[107,107,107,1],[125,125,125,1],[111,117,129,1],[82,83,88,1],[175,175,175,1],[114,114,114,1],[126,126,126,1],[105,105,105,1],[208,208,208,1],[123,144,175,1]]},{id:4,teamId:4,image:"/images/rise_repeat.jpg",audio:"/audios/rise_repeat.wav",colors:[[170,151,119,1],[182,163,131,1],[186,170,136,1],[181,161,128,1],[177,154,120,1],[179,166,134,1],[194,174,147,1],[193,176,146,1],[192,173,140,1],[182,166,133,1],[194,183,155,1],[196,185,157,1],[249,231,209,1],[200,182,158,1],[190,178,154,1],[188,168,141,1],[188,154,117,1],[154,130,96,1],[216,215,210,1],[201,190,170,1],[214,203,181,1],[218,204,178,1],[223,210,191,1],[191,179,157,1],[188,172,146,1]]},{id:5,teamId:5,image:"/images/mycoshell.jpg",audio:"/audios/mycoshell.wav",colors:[[252,252,252,1],[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1],[253,253,253,1],[129,129,129,1],[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1],[199,199,199,1],[123,121,96,1],[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1],[242,242,242,1],[251,251,251,1],[161,161,161,1],[97,97,97,1],[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1],[251,235,210,1],[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1]]},{id:6,teamId:6,image:"/images/curtain_call.jpg",audio:"/audios/curtain_call.wav",colors:[[197,175,161,1],[236,220,207,1],[241,225,212,1],[231,210,191,1],[211,185,162,1],[195,176,161,1],[230,213,197,1],[235,216,199,1],[229,204,182,1],[211,183,159,1],[192,169,153,1],[207,39,38,1],[228,155,120,1],[171,69,44,1],[147,30,23,1],[183,158,151,1],[220,199,180,1],[174,175,177,1],[152,25,19,1],[128,23,20,1],[83,99,133,1],[225,204,185,1],[218,197,178,1],[218,188,162,1],[220,182,145,1]]}];function I(){return l}function S(e){return l.find(a=>a.id===e)}function T(e,a=","){return e?e.split(a):[]}function B(e){return f.filter(a=>a.teamId===e)}function z(e){if(!e)return"00:00";const a=Math.floor(e/60),t=Math.floor(e%60);return`${String(a).padStart(2,"0")}:${String(t).padStart(2,"0")}`}const b={xmlns:"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg",width:"200",height:"200",class:"icon",viewBox:"0 0 1024 1024"};function y(e,a){return i(),o("svg",b,a[0]||(a[0]=[n("path",{fill:"currentColor",d:"m384 512 347.733-309.333C748.8 187.733 750.933 160 736 142.933c-14.933-17.066-42.667-19.2-59.733-4.266L292.267 480c-10.667 8.533-14.934 19.2-14.934 32s4.267 23.467 14.934 32l384 341.333C684.8 891.733 695.467 896 704 896c12.8 0 23.467-4.267 32-14.933 14.933-17.067 14.933-44.8-4.267-59.734z"},null,-1)]))}const v={render:y},w={class:"logo flex justify-between px-5 mt-1"},_={key:0,class:"flex align-center"},k={class:"flex-hide-576"},j={__name:"NavLogo",props:{hasBack:{type:Boolean,default:!1}},setup(e){return(a,t)=>{const c=p;return i(),o("div",w,[n("div",{class:"btn-text flex align-center cursor-pointer",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=x=>a.$router.go(-1))},[e.hasBack?(i(),o("span",_,[s(m,{size:20,icon:r(v),color:"var(--el-color-success)"},null,8,["icon"]),t[1]||(t[1]=g("back "))])):u(a.$slots,"default",{key:1},void 0,!0)]),n("div",k,[s(c,{src:r(h)},null,8,["src"])])])}}},L=d(j,[["__scopeId","data-v-0b9302a5"]]);export{L as N,S as a,f as b,B as c,z as f,I as g,T as s};
